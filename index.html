    <p>Ana has always been a fighter as a person and as an athlete. She has always been a picture of health.</p>
    <p>
      Ana is a single mother of an eight year old boy, Kadu.</p>

<p>One year ago, she was diagnosed with lymphoma non-Hodkins stage 4, a type of cancer of the lymphatic system.

She had to stop working as a physical trainer to undergo chemo and radio therapy, losing her single source of income.</p>

<p>She was on remission, but on January 24th she was admitted to the emergency room with severe headaches and hospitalized after two brain tumors were found.</p>
<p>On January 29th, she underwent brain surgery in order to remove the tumors with the hope that the surgery would not only be successful, but also not interfere with the integrity of her brain.</p>

<p>Ana’s mother arrived from Brazil moments before she went into  her delicate surgery.</p>

<p>Ana has tremendous faith and has kept her spirits up throughout this trial. Her surgery has been successful and she is in observation and recovery.</p>

<p>However, Ana will not be able to go back to work right away…</p>
